Day 1: Print Statements
To put anytext on screen, it has to be in quotes "", and those quotes have to be in brackets () with a lower case print in front.
A bunch of text is called a String.
Ex: print("Hello There")
Use the triple quote """ if you want to write a big chunk of text with gaps or line breaks.
Ex: print("""Anything that starts
with three quotes, and ends
in three quotes can span
many lines and even contain " symbols
within it without freaking anything out!""")

Day 57: Recursion
Recursion is a type of program where you get a subroutine to call itself. 
Recursion lets us solve problems in a more human way. 
Some mathematical problems can just be solved better using recursion.
Ex: We want to print out a sequence of the same emoji, reducing by 2 emojis per line. (eg print a row of 9, then a row of 7, then 5, etc. until we get none).
Ex:
def reverse(value):
  if value <= 0:
    print("Done!")
    return
  # This `if` provides the 'stop' condition for the program. Otherwise it would run forever.
  else: # if we're not at the stop condition.
    for i in range(value):
      print("ðŸ’¯", end="") # Outputs 'value' emojis
    print() # New line
    reverse(value - 2) # takes 2 off the value and calls the subroutine again with this new number. Eg if value was 7 it would call 'reverse(value)' again with value as 5.
reverse(5)
